<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Our project


There are many great Pokedex websites on the internet; however, it is hard to find one that is easy and straightforward to use. We want to create a Pokedex web so  easy to use that it'll be the last one you ever need to look at to find basic information on Pokemon

Here's why Our Pokedex is better than others:
* We built it from scratch
* spent countless days and hours
* easy to use and navigate
  

Of course, this is not a simple task to complete



### Built With

These are the things we used to produce this website

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PokeApi
* Chatgpt
